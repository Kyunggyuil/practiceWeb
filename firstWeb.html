      I wanna hold 'em like they do in Texas plays<br>
      Fold 'em, let 'em, hit me, raise it baby stay with me (I love it)<br>
      Love Game intuition play the cards with spades to start<br>
      And after he's been hooked I'll play the one that's on his heart<br>
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh<br>
      I'll get him hot, show him what I've got<br>
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh,<br>
      I'll get him hot, show him what I've got<br>
      Can't read my<br>
      Can't read my<br>
      No he can't read my poker face<br>
      (She's got me like nobody)<br>
      Can't read my<br>
      Can't read my<br>
      No he can't read my poker face<br>
      (She is gonna let nobody)<br>
      P p p poker face, p p p poker face<br>
      (Muh muh muh muh)<br>
      P p p poker face, p p poker face<br>
      (Muh muh muh muh)<br>
      I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be<br>
      A little gambling is fun when you're with me (I love it)<br>
      Russian Roulette is not the same without a gun<br>
      And baby when it's love, if its not rough it isn't fun, fun<br>
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh<br>
      I'll get him hot, show him what I've got<br>
      Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-e-oh-oh-oh,<br>
      I'll get him hot, show him what I've got<br>
      Can't read my<br>
      Can't read my<br>
      No he can't read my poker face<br>
      (She's got me like nobody)<br>
      Can't read my<br>
      Can't read my<br>
      No he can't read my poker face<br>
      (She is gonna let nobody)<br>

      (Muh muh muh muh)<br>
      P p p poker face, p p p poker face<br>
      (Muh muh muh muh)<br>
      I won't tell you that I love you<br>
      Kiss or hug you<br>
      'Cause I'm bluffing with my muffin<br>
      I'm not lying I'm just stunning with my love glue gunnin'<br>
      Just like a chick in the casino<br>
      Take your bank before I pay you out<br>
      I promise this, promise this<br>
      Check this hand cause I'm marvelous<br>
      Can't read my<br>
      Can't read my<br>
      No he can't read my poker face<br>
      (She's got me like nobody)<br>
